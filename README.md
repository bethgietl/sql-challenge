# sql-challenge

The SQL challenge started with creating an ERD diagram to show the connections to the six different CSVs. I exported the diagram to postgres to create the tables. I then joined different tables together per the assignment and saved the code as an 'sql' file in Visual Studio. 

I created a new python file where I imported sqlalchemy to read in the sql tables for further data visualization including creating a histogram and bar chart.
